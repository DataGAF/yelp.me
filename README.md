## **Project Purpose**

The **Yelp.me** project aims to provide personalized venue and service recommendations to help people break out of their routine and explore new options. Often, individuals tend to revisit the same venues and miss out on unique experiences available around them. Yelp.me addresses this by offering tailored suggestions, encouraging users to "Discover More ðŸ’Ÿ "
